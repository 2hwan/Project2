  <p>
	Incheon Songdo is a smart city built on 1,500 acres of land fill along the neighboring city of Incheon Yellow Sea waterfront. After living in Songdo Incheon for more than a year, I found myself completely in love with the city. Incheon Songdo has now become my new home.
Incheon Songdo is connected by four beautiful bridges to city of Incheon. In addition, there is the majestic Incheondaegyuo Bridge. As the longest bridge in South Korea, it provides direct transportation from Songdo to Incheon International Airport (about 20-minute car ride). As a part of the Incheon Free Economic Zone (IFEZ), Incheon Songdo incooporates up-to-date technology and environmental-friendly living for the residents and visitors.
Hopefully youâ€™ll keep Incheon Songdo in your heart forever.
